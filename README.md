# trex: Turbo Regular Expressions

Regexes with arbitrary predicates

## TODOs:

### Critical
- Makefile
- Type erasure for iterators
- Finish writing NFA generation code
- Print readable format NFA for debugging
- Code to apply a regex to a collection,
  working with NFAs
- Tests

### Niceties
- Pretty operators to construct regexes
- Break up into multiple files
- Additional regular expressions
- Converting NFAs to DFAs
